IV. XSWAP SERVICE AND SERVICE COSTS
4.1 Xswap is a perpetual contract trading platform that provides digital assets as margin and uses price pairs such as currency pairs, commodity futures and stock indices as indicators. Buyers and sellers conduct point-to-point transactions directly on our platform, and Xswap as a platform provider is neither a buyer nor a seller in these transactions. Users can transfer and withdraw their digital assets at Xswap subject to the restrictions of this Agreement. Users can query their digital assets in the managed wallet in Xswap.
Xswap provides users with the following transaction services: 
(1) You can use one type of digital asset as margin to participate in the trading of mainstream foreign exchange currency pairs, commodities, indices and other market varieties as indicators of the perpetual contract. You will not be able to pre-determine or trade with predetermined users. Similarly, a contract may be partially completed or completed by multiple matching contracts from different users.
(2) Digital wallet (Charge and withdraw coins): Users can transfer digital assets from other addresses to the Account specified by the digital asset custodian that Xswap cooperates with or transfer the digital assets from the Account to the other wallet address specified by the Users. Xswap will ask the custodian of the digital asset to take custody of the digital asset on your behalf and shall acknowledge that you are the revenue owner of any digital asset in your digital wallet. Xswap shall not use your digital assets as securities or use your digital assets in any way, except with your lawful instructions and prior authorization. The digital assets that Xswap holds on your behalf may be stored with other Users' digital assets.
By agreeing to these terms, you expressly agree that your digital assets will be stored with other users' digital assets. The rights and interests of individual users will not be identifiable by separate document of title or other electronic records. In the event of inevitable losses, you may not be able to receive all of your profits and may split the losses proportionally. You declare and warrant that you will remain the ultimate owner of the valid legal benefit of any digital asset entrusted by Xswap, and that you will not act as a nominee or trustee of any other person and will not transfer, assign, mortgage, charge or otherwise create any security interest or encumbrance on the relevant digital assets without Xswap’s prior written consent. 
Except for the services listed under Article 4.1, Xswap cannot provide the User with any investment, legal, tax or other professional advice on the Xswap transaction, and any information, discussion, analysis, price, etc. provided by any platform is a general comment, and shall not be deemed as advice for any transaction to be conducted by the User. If the User needs professional advice, the User should consult the relevant professional personnel for investment, legal, tax or other professional advice related to the transaction. Xswap does not assume any direct or indirect losses (including any loss of profits) resulting from the User's reliance on the above general comments. 
4.2 Xswap shall not be construed or used as making offers to users of any country or region where the services provided by Xswap, are illegal.
4.3 Users understand and agree that they may face gap risk when using Xswap to make transactions, that is, the price of various contracts on the Xswap platform is subject to sudden and significant changes in the market due to sudden major events, accidents, force majeure, etc. Due to the characteristics of the Xswap transaction, i.e. perpetual contract, the User's Xswap contract transaction is closed to the new counterparty after the current counterpart closes, and Xswap is unable to recover the debt arising from the transaction from a breakout or breakout customer, so it is likely that the actual profit of the User may be less than the expected profit of the contract.
4.4 The User understands and agrees that Xswap has the right to provide the necessary information such as registration information and transaction records filled out by the User on the Xswap website at the request of the government department (including the judicial and administrative departments).
